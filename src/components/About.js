            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Growing up in Bellevue, WA where the massive presence of global tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, T-Mobile and Adobe is undeniable, the tech industry has always been in my periphery. I didn't start to seriously consider coding as a passion until I took AP Computer Science in high school, which I loved a lot but ultimately went on to go to school for acting. Fast forward to 2020, I was feeling professionally and intellectually plateaued and was looking to make a career shift. I remembered the excitement I felt for coding in high school and decided to enroll in a Software Engineering Bootcamp. Attending this bootcamp, reinvigorated my zeal for continual learning and made me excited to craft unique digital experiences in an online landscape.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>I believe in a growth-centric approach to development. With new technology being introduced everyday, I understand the necessity of curiosity and exploration within the tech world. From my training as an actor and my experience in hospitality, I have picked up a unique skill set that aid this approach. I am an exceptionally quick-learner, an adept communicator, and a thoughtful collaborator. My goal is to bring these skills, coupled with my passion for code, to exciting work that will have a positive impact on the world.</p>
